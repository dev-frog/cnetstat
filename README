This is the netstat(8) command for Linux.  This is a fork of the net-tools
source code and reduced to just the netstat(8) command since nearly all of
the other net-tools commands are obsolete or irrelevant.

The code was forked from the net-tools Sourceforge git repo.  Do not send
any questions about this netstat command to the net-tools developers.
